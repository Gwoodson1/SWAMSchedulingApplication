# SWAMSchedulingApplication
Application for Swimming With A Mission to more easily pair instructors with swimmers and find substitutes when needed.

Project Structure Overview
backend/ Directory
app/ Subdirectory
__init__.py: Initializes the Flask app with all configurations, including database setup, app configuration, and route registrations. It's the central configuration hub for the backend part of the application.
models.py: Defines the SQLAlchemy database models, representing the structure of the database tables and their relationships.
views.py: Contains the Flask route definitions, handling the logic for incoming HTTP requests and returning responses. Typically used for API endpoints.
templates/: Stores HTML templates (if used), though with a React frontend, this may be minimally used or not at all.
config.py (optional): Manages configuration settings for the Flask application, such as database URIs, secret keys, and other environment-specific settings.
run.py: The entry point to the Flask application. Configures and runs the Flask server, including setup to serve React static files if configured as such.
requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies required for the Flask application, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.
frontend/ Directory
public/: Contains static assets like images, favicon.ico, and the index.html file that serves as the entry point to the React application.
src/: Contains all the JavaScript and CSS files for the React application. This includes React components, hooks, utilities, services for API calls, and styling files.
App.js: The main React component that serves as the root of the user interface.
index.js: The entry script that renders the React app into the DOM.
package.json: Manages project metadata and dependencies for the React app. Also includes scripts for building, testing, and starting the development server.
node_modules/: Directory created by npm that stores all of the project's npm dependencies.
build/: Contains the compiled production build of the React application, which Flask can be configured to serve.
Root Directory
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, dependencies, and other important information to help new developers understand the project structure and setup.
Usage of Each Component
The backend handles all data management, business logic, and API services.
The frontend manages all user interactions, data presentation, and client-side logic.
Flask serves static files generated by the React build process, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing, while Flask focuses on API endpoints.
This structure ensures that your project is well-organized and modular, separating concerns between client-side and server-side functionalities effectively. Each component and file has a clear purpose, supporting maintainability and scalability.
